# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding competition/event run by Eric Wastl from Dec 
1 - 25. This repo contains my solutions for various AoC problems. As of now, I
have only completed part of 2022's set and have only written solutions in
Pyton. I am slowly adding solutions to my collection and aim to complete 2022
before Dec 1, 2023.
